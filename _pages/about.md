Welcome to my github.io personal homepage.My name is Zhihai He.

I am currently a postgraduate student at [East China University of Science and Technology](https://www.ecust.edu.cn/main.htm), majoring in electronic information. I graduated from [Xiangtan University](https://www.xtu.edu.cn/) with a bachelor's degree in automation in 2022.

My research interests are mainly in  **AI**.

Unfortunately, I don't have any articles published yet, but I'm sure there will be some valuable work in the published column in the future.
